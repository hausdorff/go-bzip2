# A "code notebook" for an implementation of bzip2

I've never written a consequential Go program in my life, so naturally my first go project is to implement bzip2 for the Go standard library. Fuck the police!

This project SHOULD NOT BE USED, it is essentially me committing code in a stream-of-consciousness manner, attempting to figure out both bzip2 and the Go language at the same time.
